# Java Foundations

This repository documents my journey building **strong Java fundamentals from first principles**, with a focus on how Java actually works under the hood rather than surface-level syntax.

## What this repository covers

- Java execution model (JDK, JRE, JVM)
- Compilation and bytecode
- Memory basics (stack vs heap)
- Core language syntax
- Clean, readable Java code
- Basic problem solving

## Why this repository exists

The goal is to develop **engineering-level understanding** of Java — not just the ability to write code that “works”, but the ability to explain *why* it works.

This foundation will later support:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Backend development (Spring Boot)
- Scalable system design
